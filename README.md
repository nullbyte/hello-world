# An obligatory Hello World repository.

As a developer I believe that the best way to start learning any new programming language is to write an '*Hello World*' program.

This is a time-honored tradition in computer programming and I want to adhere, hence I made this **hello-world** repo.

I will probably update this repo as soon as I start to learn new programming languages.
